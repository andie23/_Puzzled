# Description: Module contains logic for applying various 
#              states to an object. A list of states to apply
#              is defined in globalDict states and these states are 
#              executed based on predefined conditions. I.E.
#              if a state is defined to change color upon match
#              then the matchColorState will be applied to the object
#              if it's in the correct position or is a match.
