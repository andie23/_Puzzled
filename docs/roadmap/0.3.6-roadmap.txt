- Implement a general canvas object

- Create a seperate file with canvas class

-All widgets i.e. text and buttons must not be hardcoded into the canvas... instead, the canvas must have declaration of button widget objects. These objects will then be passed to a button widget in a seperate script.

- When adding a button to a command, it should be saved under the key "onclick" instead of command

- add an additional option for onhover in button global dictionary

[DONE]- itemgroup must be a list instead of dictionary(inorder to maintain sorting order)

- remove log statements in state

- state actions must have *args and **kwargs as default arguments
