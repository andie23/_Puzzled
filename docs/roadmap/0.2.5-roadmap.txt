- add mechanisms for Cleaning up timers or states on status change. 
  currently, when blocks switch states from matching to mismatch, timers that 
  handle status expiry continue working in the background when they're not 
  supposed to in some situations. 

- Fix bug that occurs when blocks matching static block puzzle load don't register a match.
